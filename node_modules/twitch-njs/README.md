# twitch-njs NodeJS module

This is a small module that communicates with the Twitch API. Unlike some
other modules, it is straight-forward and doesn't require you to use an
API token for simple, "public" operations.

I mainly wrote it for myself and decided to publish it should anyone else
need it. Should you have any change requests or need for alterations, feel
free to either send me your request via the issue tracker, or DIY and push
your changes.

The module makes use of ECMAScript 6 features; it will likely not work on
older NodeJS versions. (Although, should I ever find the time and will to
do so, I will make move over to Typescript, so it can be transcoded down
to ECMAScript 3 and be compatible with even the most archaic of all NodeJS
versions from the olden times when the world still used carrier pigeons to
dispatch commits to github.)

## Installation

### via npm

If you want to install this module via npm, you can specify the github
repository directly using one of the following methods (the former will require
a somewhat recent version of npm):

```
npm install MrManny/twitch-njs
npm install git+https://git@github.com/MrManny/twitch-njs.git
```

## Usage

## Versioning notes

The module follows the npm semantic versioning specification. This module's
version number follows the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, where:

* the MAJOR version is incremented when there are incompatible API changes,
* the MINOR version is incremented when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* the PATCH version is incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are added.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

Note that you don't necessarily have to adjust the version number in
`package.json`, I'll do it if required. But if you do, please keep the semantic
versioning guidelines in mind. See http://semver.org/ for more information.
